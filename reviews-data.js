        text: `Why I Love Grip & Grab: Progress > Perfection

Growing up in the Indian education system, I internalized the message that if I wasn‚Äôt among the top 5 in my class, I was insignificant. This mindset extended into PE classes, where I was always picked last for any group sport. As a chubby girl with limited athletic ability, it wasn‚Äôt surprising. Eventually, I stopped doing anything I wasn‚Äôt naturally good at, including challenging my body.

Grip & Grab is one of the rare places where it doesn‚Äôt matter what level you‚Äôre at‚Äîyou‚Äôll always feel like you belong. I was genuinely surprised when, within my first week, each coach I interacted with had learned my name! The coaches here offer the same encouragement to everyone, whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an advanced member pulling off feats that seem superhuman to me. They value your progress, your consistency, and, on some days, just the fact that you showed up. Even if you miss a few days, they‚Äôll text you to check in and make sure you're doing okay.

I originally joined the gym to confront my fear of the gym itself, and Grip & Grab has turned out to be the perfect find. The coaches (particularly, Harish sir, Ankit sir, and Nitish sir) are exceptional‚Äîcaring, receptive to feedback, and genuinely invested in your goals. They don‚Äôt shame you for not being able to do something, for having less stamina than others, or even for being nervous to try a particular movement. They meet you exactly where you are. Because of this, the community they‚Äôve built here is just as supportive. People will cheer you on when you finally nail that handstand kick, and they‚Äôll plead with the coaches to go easy on you when you're facing 100 burpees at the end of a circuit.

The truth is, I‚Äôm still a chubby woman with limited athleticism. But at G&G, I can see my strength, flexibility, and endurance improving without any pressure to change how my body looks. My body is capable of doing more than it could six months ago when I first joined, and if I stay committed, I know I‚Äôll achieve even more in the next six months. This is the one place I genuinely look forward to going every morning‚Äîa habit I never thought I‚Äôd form. I may never be a "gym bro", but I‚Äôm definitely a "G&G bro" now.`

        text: `After 4 years of no physical activity, I started my fitness journey with Grip and Grab in Saket. While I did try other trainers in the middle, the knowledge, experience and expertise of the trainers at Grip and Grab is better than anyone I have trained with in the past. They don't just focus on making you look fitter or more muscular, but making sure you feel good and see an improvement in your daily life and gain muscle without triggering back pain. Many times, trainers don't individualise plans to your body and make you do generic workouts which delays progress and can risk injury but thats not the case here.
The environment is also warm and non judgemental so if you're somebody thats intimidated to start your gym journey, look no further, start here.`

The trainers are highly qualified in their field and extremely patient and supportive which gives you enough freedom to learn a new skill. You get personal attention even in a group setting and every movement is microscopically monitored. They have helped me learn skills that I never thought were possible for me to do and they didn‚Äôt make it feel very tough.

Grip & Grab not only transforms your body but also your mindset towards health and fitness. It‚Äôs definitely a space everyone should explore.`

This was the first time I stepped out of my home to workout and I had never thought working out would be fun for me and I could learn handstand, among other skills, in matter of just a month.  The journey to fitness has been very smooth and there is no looking back. Our coach Bhanu is very very supportive and makes learning everything at the gym super super easy and fun.
Another thing that I absolutely love about this calisthenics studio (something you wouldn't find somewhere else) is the space it is located at- green and spacious. Also, you get to workout with an incredible set of people- forming a community.
If you want to have fun along with achieving your fitness goals and also learn skills that you once thought were unachievable for you, Grip and Grab is your go-to.`

Magic from‚Ä¶the little things I never knew were so integral to practice each and every time that we exercise‚Ä¶like, muscle mind connection, posture, the importance of mobility (and how it‚Äôs different from flexibility). Being aware of these things and training with a coach who is mindful about them makes every session extremely efficient and productive;

Magic from‚Ä¶the feeling I get when I can carry both my children in my arms and walk a short distance without pulling a muscle because of the strength/techniques I have developed to help avoid small injuries;

Magic from‚Ä¶ the genuine sincerity Harish brings to every lesson. Well crafted, progressive, tailored and fun! A LOT of fun!

God willing, Grip&Grab is not going to be just a place to exercise‚Ä¶ it will be a family, a community and a way of life.

Commit to being consistent. Leave the rest to the Master. Watch your magic unfold!

I wish Harish and his team all the very best and thank them for help with my journey.`

The way the whole team ( trainers ) work individually on everyone and taught me how to get started, master the basic and then move on to the more advanced stages is very helpful.

I was facing the shoulder stiffness and other problem some time back . The whole team had helped me to every extent in overcoming that shoulder problem of mine and in developing strength and better Range of motion . I am always thankful to Grip and Grab for the support and patience they showed with me in coming out of shoulder injury .

I would strongly recommend everyone to  join Gro and Grab (Calisthenics Family ) if you‚Äôre looking for a challenge, if you‚Äôre willing to put some time and effort into it AND if you want to make real progress while having fun because that‚Äôs the most important part .

I have seen huge improvements because of the hard work they put on flexibility and strengthening of small muscles ( which majorly we ignore) and all major & minor joint movements . The stretching part does benefit as well if you ask me. I notice that I got more flexible which helped me with the other exercises, especially

My stamina, strength, endurance level and will power has risen exponentially. Calisthenics taught me to have control of each and every muscle in the body. At last and altogether calisthenics is way better than gymming.

Recommend to come and explore the better way of injury free movement with increase in your fitness levels and goals . Give a try and join-Grip and Grab`

The workouts are so different everyday that not even a single day you will feel monotonous.
The place is always full of energy and positive vibes which is really important.
I joined when I was facing severe lower back issue for 2 years. I joined G&G last year and Now it‚Äôs been a year and it‚Äôs vanished and I am doing dead lifts, which I never thought I will be ever able to do in my life again.

Grip&Grab is a community and place of building+learning fitness, mobility and most of all, about your own body. Harish sir has set up the environment to be so involving and motivating, that you will want to be consistent. Pair that with his and fellow instructors‚Äô(Ankit & Bhanu bhaiya) coaching skills, and that just elevates the complete experience to new levels.

I joined to build, bulk up and learn calisthenics skills, but along with that I have learnt so much more about my own body and muscle-mind connection that doing certain movements feel natural now. The best part has been individual focus and body type based workout designs.

The distinct set up of the two floors make it an open place to explore new skills and techniques in bodybuilding, flexibility or overall calisthenics to advance towards your goals. While the weekdays are mostly focused workouts(with some fun), the weekends are extremely enjoyable while learning mobility skills and further development.`

I believe what sets them apart is the knowledge they are sharing with their clients along with the movements, making them aware of it and not just randomly making you do anything. They do give equal importance to rest and recovery! Apart from that the space is clean, spacious and well maintained. There is something for every BODY, Looking forward for continued association!`

Every session here is a like a workshop curated according to each individual's needs and limitations. More often that not you will end up learning or discovering something new about your own body or the human body in general. You will be encouraged to understand and feel the logic and the impact every movement of every exercise. Or as coach Harish likes to call it "to form a mind-body" connection. Its not easy but if there is one person I know who has the right experience, knowledge and most importantly, the right mindset to help you then it's coach Harish. And I can say this with at most confidence because Harish's training has helped alleviate my chronic lower back pains and correct my posture in a relatively short span of time.

Lastly, thanks to Harish and his team for all the hard work and patience and wish Grip & Grap all the success!`

I was looking for something else than regular gym. It bored me a lot. I joined MMA for a period of time. Then I got to know about Grip&Grab on Google. I immediately contacted Bhanu sir and took a subscription. It's been a little less than two months now and I haven't skipped even a single day. I must tell the difference in my body and thinking about fitness. They are :-
1. I learned the importance of a good trainer in the journey of fitness(Bhanu sir is the best trainer I have got till now)
2. I got to know about basics of muscle mobility and strength. I can experience it while training.
3. The training process and competitive environment which includes a wide variety of fun-to-do exercises especially circuits helps the body to push limits.

I went for trecking on a weekend in Rishikesh. I felt strength in my legs. That moment I felt good about my decision to join Grip&Grab.`

His calm yet fun demeanor makes every session enjoyable and motivating. He holds each of us accountable, ensuring we stay on track with our fitness goals without rushing, always reminding us to keep our goals in mind while enjoying the process.

One of the best aspects of Grip & Grab is the community. Working out with people of all age groups adds a unique, supportive atmosphere to the studio. The term "impossible" doesn‚Äôt exist here because Bhanu breaks down every exercise into the smallest of steps and explains the logic behind each movement, making everything achievable. It‚Äôs this approach that made me fall in love with calisthenics, and now even both my sisters join me for workouts.

The studio itself is beautiful, creating a perfect environment to start my day. I honestly can‚Äôt see myself going back to any other gym. Grip & Grab has set a standard that‚Äôs hard to match. I cannot recommend this place enough.`
